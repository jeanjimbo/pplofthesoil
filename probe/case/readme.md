#Case Designs for PeopleOfTheSoil

The 3D model is a mock up of how the final soil sensor could look. For reference, the small tab at the top represents a USB port (for connection to a phone or separate module for data transmission), the prongs at the bottom would ultimately be coated in a conductive material. The dimensions of the model are ~100 x  40 x ~17.5 mm.

In order to make it suitable for 3D printing, some compromises have been made, such as the way that prongs are flush with the bottom of the probe. As the main purpose of the model at this point is to experiment with high level design and ergonomics, these are reasonable compromises.

#Further Work

As the PCB design matures and the first prototypes are produced, the case design will be updated to simply enclose the PCB, rather than mocking-up the entire probe as it currently does. Ultimately, a cheap, 3D printed enclosure for the PCB will be considered as part of the final sensor.
